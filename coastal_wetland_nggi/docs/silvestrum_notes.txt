In this first two years of including coastal wetlands in the Inventory only carbon stock changes in soils and not biomass were calculated. Inclusion of emergent marsh biomass is anticipated to be included in future iterations based upon developing research (Byrd et al. in review).  
Country-specific reference soil carbon stocks and carbon accumulation rates stratified by mineral and organic soils , vegetation (based upon NOAA C-CAP classes) and climate zone were derived from literature review (See SOM Table 1). 

Tier 2 level estimates of soil C removal associated with annual soil C accumulation from managed Vegetated Coastal Wetlands Remaining Vegetated Coastal Wetland (for wetland remaining and open water converted to wetland) and Land Converted to Vegetated Coastal Wetlands were developed with country-specific soil C removal factors multiplied by activity data of respective land areas. In effect, soil carbon removals were calculated for all intact vegetated wetlands and assumed to be zero for unvegetated bare grounds and open water. For restoring wetlands, carbon removals were recognized with the transition from other lands to vegetated coastal wetlands. 

Estimates of emissions with conversion of vegetated wetlands to open water applied a combination of Tier 2 level mapping and reference soil carbon stocks, and Tier 1 assumptions about depth of impacted soils. The Tier 1 methodological guidance from the Wetland Supplement for estimating emissions following the methodology for excavation when Vegetated Coastal Wetlands are converted to Unvegetated Open Water Coastal Wetlands, assuming a 1 m depth of disturbed soil.  This 1 m depth of disturbance is consistent with estimates of wetland C loss provided in the literature (Crooks, et al., 2009; Couvillon et al., 2011; Delaune and White, 2012; IPCC 2014)
