The folder contains figure outputs of the carbon accumulation rate workflow. 

Comparison of Lit-Review and Automated Output.pdf - Is a main project deliverable showing the relationship between literature-based and algorithm-based carbon accumulation rates with uncertainty visualized for the algorithmic approach. 

State Level Carbon Burial Distribution Horizon.pdf - A main deliverable, state and habitat-level distributions of carbon accumulation rate, calculated using algorithmic approach, for radio-cesium and historical horizon-based dating approaches. 

State Level Carbon Burial Distribution Pb.pdf - A main deliverable, state and habitat-level distributions of carbon accumulation rate, calculated using algorithmic approach, for lead-210 dated cores.

cs137 - Folder contains radio-cesium profiles for all cores in the Coastal Carbon Library, visualized with the assumed date of radio-cesium peaks (in most cases 1963), and an assigned level of confidence (0 through 3) taking into account strength of the peak and separation from neighboring depth increments. Sample level uncertainty in radioactivity, either originating from the source or gap filled, is also visualized. Files are named by their study_id and site_id, and separate cores of depth increments within a site are featured as separate panels.

pb210 - Folder contains lead-210 profiles for all cores in the Coastal Carbon Library. Profiles include total lead-210, either measured in source or gap filled, excess lead-210 if measured, and radium-226 if measured. Sample level uncertainty in radioactivity, either originating from the source or gap filled, is also visualized. Files are named by their study_id and site_id, and separate cores of depth increments within a site are featured as separate panels.
