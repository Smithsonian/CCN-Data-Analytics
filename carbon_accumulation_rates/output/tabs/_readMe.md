File includes tabular outputs of the carbon accumulation rates workflow. 

c14_ages.csv - Contains radiocarbon ages used in the Plum and BACON workflow.

ccn_car_210Pb.csv - Contains core level information on carbon accumulation rates based on the Plum workflow. 

cs_and_horizon_car.csv - Contains core level information on carbon accumulation rates based on the radiocesium and historical sediment horizon workflows. 

Cs137_and_Horizon_based_CARs_state_habitat_impact_summary.csv - State, habitat, and impact level summary statistics for carbon accumulation rates (grams carbon per square meter per year) based on radiocesium dates and historical sediment horizons. 

historical_horizon_accretion_rates.csv - Accretion rate information for historical sediment horizons. 

Pb210_based_CARs_state_habitat_impact_summary.csv - State, habitat, and impact level summary statistics for carbon accumulation rates (grams carbon per square meter per year) based on lead-210 dating. 

pb210_profiles.csv - Total lead-210 and radium-226 depth profiles for all cores within the Coastal Carbon Library, which have been converted to a common unit (becquerels per kilogram) and missing lab errors, total lead-210 values, and dry bulk densities gap filled when necessary.

peak_137Cs_accretion_rates.csv - Accretion rate information for radiocesium dates.
